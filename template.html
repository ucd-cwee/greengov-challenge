				  <h2>Background</h2>
                  <p>This application was created at the <a href="http://cwee.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis Center for Water-Energy Efficiency</a> as
                    part of the <a href = http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/data_databases/data_innov_challenge.shtml
                    target='_blank'>2016 CA Water Board Data Innovation Challenge</a>. The underlying analysis was extended and updated in 2017, and a paper detailing the
					methodology and results has been submitted for publication in an academic journal. Links to the published article will provided once available.</p>

                  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                  <p>
                    In April 2015, Governor Brown mandated a 25 percent statewide reduction in water use by urban water suppliers across the state
                    (relative to 2013 levels) with differentiated conservation targets for utilities with varying levels of baseline per capita usage
                    (<a href = 'https://www.gov.ca.gov/docs/4.1.15_Executive_Order.pdf' target='_blank'>Executive Order B-29-15</a>). The more than 400 public
                    water agencies affected by the regulation were also required to report monthly progress towards the conservation goal
                    to the State Water Board. This application uses the reported data to visualize how different water utilities
                    have responded to this mandate.  In addition to displaying a summary of water use relative to the conservation target for each district,
                    we also calculate the electricity savings associated with the reduced demand on water infrastructure services using estimates of average
                    energy intensity per hydrologic region. We then convert the electricity savings into avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on an
                    average emissions factor estimate for the California electricity grid. We can view the total water, energy, and GHG savings aggregated
                    at the state level, as well as for each of the individual water utilities. One of the significant findings is that the electricity savings
                    associated with the observed achievements in water conservation is roughly equivalent to the total <span style = "font-style: italic;">first-year</span>
                    electricity savings estimated for all of the energy IOU efficiency programs implemented in the period from July 2015 through June 2016.
					In addition, the water conservation-related GHG savings over the period of the mandate from June 2015 through
                    May 2016), represent the equivalent of taking about 111,000 cars off the road for a year.

                  <h2>Detailed Methodology for Statewide Water-Energy Calculation</h2>
                    <b>Water Conservation Calculation</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Pulled urban water systems monthly consumption data reported to the CA State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) for June 2015 – May 2016.</li>
                      <li>Compared mandate period data to baseline time period (2013) to calculate total water conserved for each reporting water agency. 2013 was used as baseline comparison period to match the requirements of Governor Brown&#39;s Executive Order B-29-15.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Energy Intensity of Water Provision</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>We consolidated estimates for average outdoor (excludes wastewater) energy intensity estimates (Table ES-3, p. xvi) for all ten hydrologic regions in California from the Navigant Consulting report entitled, “Water-Energy Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Final Report” (updated errata report values were used [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]). The energy intensity estimate is carried out both for energy procured from investor-owned energy utilities (IOUs), and for all energy, regardless of producer (total).</li>
                      <li>Using GIS, we associated every urban water agency reporting to (SWRCB) to its hydrologic zone, and thus assigned the unique regional energy intensity value to each water agency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Energy Savings</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>We estimated the total water utility-based electricity savings associated with water conserved by each water agency, by multiplying the total water conservation during the mandate with the energy intensity estimates of the associated hydrologic zone.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Cost per Unit Electricity Saved</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A recent SWRCB report [<a href="#ref-7">7</a>] (Table 4, p.23) estimates that the cost of water conservation to water suppliers (not including lost revenue) is roughly $75/acre-foot.</li>
                      <li>Using this number, we estimated the cost per GWH of electricity savings achieved through water conservation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Comparative Electricity Savings from IOU Energy Efficiency Programs</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>We used the quarterly energy savings data collected from the CA Public Utilities Commission website [<a href="#ref-6">6</a>] on Energy Efficiency Program Data. Specifically, we queried time series (by quarter) electricity savings data by end use to find the electricity savings associated with Q3 2015 - Q2 2016.</li>
                    </ul>

                  <h2>Key Considerations</h2>
                  <p>The comparison between the estimated electricity saved through water conservation and the electricity saved through the IOU EE programs is complicated by a number of differences in how the data are collected and presented as well as a number of assumptions made by the research team and the studies on which they relied.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Energy intensity is much more nuanced [<a href="#ref-8">8</a>] between (and even within) water agencies than is provided by the energy intensity estimates by hydrologic zone from the Navigant Consulting report.</li>
                    <li>The vast majority of the electricity savings through the IOU EE Programs represents investments in EE hardware with potentially greater persistence than the observed water savings, which may have a much higher behavioral component. [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</li>
                    <li>To compare the cost of electricity and GHG savings achieved through water conservation to the costs of existing energy efficiency and GHG reduction programs, we need to
					estimate the per unit cost of these savings. Normalizing the cost comparisons across multiple programs also requires addressing the duration of different project periods (or "useful lifetimes" for technology installations). To accommodate this variation in the persistence of electricity and GHG savings, we estimated the levelized cost of saved electricity
					(LCSE) and the levelized cost of saved GHG emissions (LCSG) under several potential scenarios.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2>UC Davis Center for Water-Energy Efficiency</h2>
                  <p>Around the world, water and energy resources are increasingly stressed by expanding demand, diminished supply, and
                      environmental degradation, all of which occur within the broader context of complex economic and regulatory challenges.
                      Historically, public policy and business practice have treated water and energy as separate resources, but they are inextricably
                      linked. Water delivery and treatment systems and the energy production and distribution infrastructure are intertwined and
                      interdependent. Unfortunately, our ability to measure, monitor, and manage this coupled water-energy system is underdeveloped.
                      The Center for Water-Energy Efficiency (CWEE) at UC Davis seeks to address this gap and advance resource use efficiency through
                      integrated water–energy management.
